Hello! I am an assistant professor of [operations, technology and information management](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/areas/operations-technology-and-information-management/) at Cornell University SC Johnson College of Business. I am also a graduate field member in [Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academics/fields-of-study/field/operations-research-and-information-engineering/).

### Research Interest
 My research focuses on data-driven decision making with uncertainty. I am seeking to provide both methodologies and practical solutions combining tools and concepts from optimization, machine learning, and statistics. From an applications perspective, my research focuses on supply chain management and retail operations. As a part of it, I actively collaborate with industrial partners in e-commerce.
