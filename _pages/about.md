Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounce: [Yoo-eh-yawng Joe-ng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am advised by Professor [Amy R. Ward](https://voices.uchicago.edu/amyward). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018.  

# Research Interests
My primary research interests are in stochastic modeling of service systems with consideration of human strategic behavior and unknown systemic information. My research uses tools from applied probability, game theory, and learning theory (in particular, online learning and reinforcement learning). 

I am currently working on (i) system design optimization problems in queueing systems with strategic customers and strategic servers; and (ii) online learning problems in queueing systems in the face of unknown system parameters, such as learning to schedule in queueing systems. 

**I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market.**
