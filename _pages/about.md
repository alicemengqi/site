Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounced: [Yoo-eh-yahng Johng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a postdoctoral principal researcher under Prof. [Vahideh Manshadi](https://vahideh-manshadi.com/) and Prof. [Rad Niazadeh](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rad-niazadeh). In 2023, I received my PhD in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu), where I was advised by Prof. [Amy R. Ward](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward), Prof. [John R. Birge](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/b/john-r-birge), and Prof. [Raga Gopalakrishnan](https://smith.queensu.ca/faculty_and_research/faculty_list/gopalakrishnan-raga.php). In 2018, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en). 

I will join [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/) as an Assistant Professor of Management Science and Operations in Fall 2024.

# Research Interests
My research focuses on stochastic modeling and optimization of service systems, with the overarching goal of devising policies that align individual incentives with the objectives of system designers. My research interests span two main areas:

- Behavior-aware Operations: I investigate how system environments influence customer and server behaviors, as well as their interactions, subsequently shaping the design of service systems through theoretical modeling and empirical/experimental studies. 
- Socially-aware Operations: I explore the crucial role of information in reconciling misaligned objectives, especially in domains with significant societal impact such as education and judicial systems. Additionally, I tackle the challenges of fairness in resource allocation within contexts like ride-sharing and emergency medical services.

My research employs tools from applied probability, queueing theory, game theory, information theory, optimization, statistics, online learning, and reinforcement learning.
