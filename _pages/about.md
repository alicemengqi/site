Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounce: [Yoo-eh-yahng Johng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am advised by Professor [Amy R. Ward](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018.  

# Research Interests
My primary research interests are in stochastic modeling of service systems with consideration of human strategic behavior and unknown systemic information. My research uses tools from applied probability, game theory, and learning theory (in particular, online learning and reinforcement learning). 

My current research focuses on (i) how strategic behavior of human customers and human servers influence service system design, and (ii) how analytical tools (e.g., online learning, reinforcement learning) can enhance performance outcomes when full knowledge of the system is unavailable.
