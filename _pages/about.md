Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounced: [Yoo-eh-yahng Johng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am advised by Professor [Amy R. Ward](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018.  

# Research Interests
My primary research interests are in stochastic modeling and optimization of "modern" stochastic service systems with consideration of human **individual human behavior** and **unknown systemic information**. 
Broadly, the goal is to provide data-driven, actionable policy recommendations to improve system efficiency and outcomes. 
My research employs tools from applied probability, game theory, optimization, statistics, and learning theory (in particular, online learning and reinforcement learning). 

I am currently working on (i) how strategic behavior of human customers and human servers influence service system design, and (ii) how analytical tools (e.g., online learning) can enhance the operational and financial efficiency when full knowledge of the system is unavailable.
