# About Me
Hello! I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Max Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Tsinghua University in 2016. 

# Research Interest
My research interest is mainly about data-driven decision making with uncertainty with the application in supply chain management and retail operations. Specifically, I'm focusing on developing robust data-driven solutions and integrating the prediction and optimization stages in decision making. I'm also interested in the interface of operations management with machine learning.
