Welcome! I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Operations Management at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Amy R. Ward](https://voices.uchicago.edu/amyward). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018.  

# Research Interest
My research mainly lies in the intersection of queueing theory, learning theory (especially online learning and reinforcement learning), and human behavioral science, with applications in service operations management. 

I am currently working on (i) system design problems with strategic customers and strategic servers in consideration; and (ii) learning problems in stochastic systems in the face of unknown system parameters, such as learning to schedule in multiclass many server queues with abandonment.
