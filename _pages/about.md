Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounced: [Yoo-eh-yahng Johng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am advised by Professor [Amy R. Ward](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018.  

**I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market!**

# Research Interests
My primary research interests are in stochastic modeling and optimization of "modern" stochastic service systems with consideration of strategic human behavior and imperfect systemic information. Broadly, the goal is to provide data-driven, actionable policy recommendations to improve system efficiency and outcomes.

</p>

I am currently working on (i) how strategic behavior of human customers and human servers influence service system design, and (ii) how analytical tools (e.g., online learning) can enhance the operational and financial efficiency when full knowledge of the system is unavailable. 

My research employs tools from applied probability, game theory, optimization, statistics, and learning theory (in particular, online learning and reinforcement learning).
