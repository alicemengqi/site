Welcome! My name is Yueyang Zhong (Pronounced: [Yoo-eh-yahng Johng](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Yueyang%20Zhong&op=translate)). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Management Science and Operations Management](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at [the University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu). I am advised by Prof. [Amy R. Ward](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/w/amy-ward), Prof. [John R. Birge](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/b/john-r-birge), and Prof. [Raga Gopalakrishnan](https://smith.queensu.ca/faculty_and_research/faculty_list/gopalakrishnan-raga.php). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng) and [Economics](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en) in 2018. I will be joining [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/) as an Assistant Professor of Management Science and Operations.

# Research Interests
My primary research interests are in stochastic modeling and optimization of "modern" stochastic service systems with consideration of individual human behavior and imperfect systemic information. Broadly, the goal is to provide actionable policy recommendations to improve system efficiency and outcomes. 

I am currently working on (i) how strategic behavior of human customers and human servers influence service system design, and (ii) how analytical tools can enhance the operational and financial efficiency when full knowledge of the system characteristics is unavailable. 

My research employs tools from applied probability, game theory, optimization, statistics, and learning theory (in particular, online learning and reinforcement learning).
